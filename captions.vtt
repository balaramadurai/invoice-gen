00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:18.280
[Music]

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.480
What is an invoice?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.630
Invoice is a document

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.660
that you give it to your customer

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.416
so that they can pay you 

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:31.450
for your service or your goods.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.720
But you are a professor and consultant. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.730
Why do you need to generate invoices?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.730
Well...

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.640
I do a service for my clients

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.884
if I'm a consultant,

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:48.999
and when I'm a professor,

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.530
I'm teaching students,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.910
so I have to generate an invoice.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.420
Why not use Excel or something simple

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.079
to generate your invoices?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.079
I've tried that.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.609
It's no good, when it... particularly, 

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:07.150
when there are many clients,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.035
managing Excels and templates 

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.799
becomes very very tricky.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.725
Why don't you hire someone, you know, professional 

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.350
to do these for you?

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.428
I've tried it. 

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:22.381
I have to give them lots of information. 

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.140
Not that there's anything wrong with them,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.130
just that I found it to be a bit too tricky.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.250
Professional software?

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.902
Good point. I've tried that too. 

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:36.900
But, what's the fun in that, right?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.850
So what did you do?

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.869
Haa.. this is the interesting part!

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.600
I took a software called Emacs Org mode

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.640
and with that, I added Python code to it.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.418
I added so many other things to it,

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:56.168
and then it became a really nice 

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.640
customizable way to generate invoices.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.549
Whoa whoa whoa... Just slow it down, bro.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.659
Give me the story.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.170
Hey. Okay... Okay... I will.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.170
Story.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.620
Uh.. Story is simple.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.590
The client wanted an invoice.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.900
So, I generated an invoice.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.419
It wasn't good enough.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.959
So, I hacked some little bit of it.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.480
I changed every time a new client came.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.848
I had to do it all over again. 

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:30.989
I did that. I did it.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.110
Then I got really tired of it.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.760
And that's what led me to all these customizations.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.632
I want features. 

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:43.249
So, rapid fire questions. Ready? Yep.

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.079
Project management? Yep.

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.079
Format customization? Yes.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.079
PDF export? Yes.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.079
Multi-client support? Yes.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.579
Washing my clothes?

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.959
Yes... No.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.013
Haa. I was just testing you, 

00:02:57.013 --> 00:03:00.900
if you're paying attention or not.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.659
Logo and signature customization? Yes.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.730
Multi-currency support? Yes.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.930
Okay, enough talky or it's just...

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Can you show me a demo that you did?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.950
Or is it just talky?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.239
Yes, of course. Demo.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.969
Okay, demo time.

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.909
Some ingredients for invoicing.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.069
Org mode, of course.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.849
Python environment and libraries for Python:

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.930
pandas, tabulate, numbers.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.260
yasnippet package, very useful.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.969
And I use for LaTeX, MikTeX packages.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.090
So, I have a project already set up.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.540
This is what we have.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.673
The project is Teaching 2021 

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:41.239
and you can set all this up.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.819
So let's start with the first and foremost.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.849
Okay, so we're going to use

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.209
the yasnippet package.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.219
uh.. um.. sorry, the invoice, okay.

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.550
This one introduced, it gives you this whole...

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.377
generates this whole bunch of code 

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:57.150
based on a template.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.371
All you're going to do 

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.939
is to type out the client's name.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.797
Okay and that's it. 

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:04.469
That's all there is to it.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.446
Okay there's a whole bunch of instructions

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.199
that you can follow.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.284
If it's for the first time,

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:10.549
use bankinfo.org.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.409
Let's check out what bankinfo.org involves.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.819
Okay so you can copy this template 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.269
from my GitHub repository.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.300
It's basically setup of the LaTeX tags,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.854
and particularly this text file, 

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:28.620
which is a template.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.469
There's some personal info 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.125
for all the details that you want.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:33.814
Bank information. 

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:35.580
You can look at it in detail

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.330
from my repo. The tax invoice...

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.840
There are some basic constructs.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.809
You can totally change any of these

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.620
to your liking.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.320
Okay, so that's bank info.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.200
Go back. That's the first part.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.540
The second part is creating a client name.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.420
So let's look at this setup,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.710
and I have one created already.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.804
So, in order to create this, 

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:03.880
all you need to do

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.610
is to use the inv-setup

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.300
invoice setup for your client,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.230
and it will give you all the information.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.790
All you need to do is type in here

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.410
and then type in the client's name,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.785
exactly the same that you see 

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.210
as the file name.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.620
Okay, client one. And that's it.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.250
You're all set for you.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.218
Okay, so that's what it looks like. 

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:28.043
All the address and stuff

00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:29.710
filled out here.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.131
Okay. And then the next one 

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:37.010
is to use the... One time,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.890
you're going to do the invoice item,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.590
which is the rate table.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.490
So let's do the invoice.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.400
Invoice item...

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.080
This is item master.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.320
So here again, another place

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.060
where you have to enter the client name,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.780
and your rate table is ready for use.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.891
Okay. So that was... 

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.749
Now we go to step two, 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.510
which is clock table for reference.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.150
Okay. Let's go to the clock table.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.660
I already set up this for ACMEClient1,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.030
and I give it a tag: billable.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.260
Okay. We will see that...

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.470
Where have I done that?

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.890
Okay, so that's the client, you know,

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.360
ACMEClient1 table teaching 2021.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.090
I've clocked it for the previous month.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.090
That's what you will see.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.090
Let's see it again.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.840
Okay. That's... Let's put the instructions.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.110
And then you go to clock table

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.490
to generate the clock table for the client.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.342
Okay. So clock table...

00:06:42.342 --> 00:06:44.335
This is only for your reference, 

00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:45.484
not going to be exported.

00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:50.586
Here we get a clock table. All right. 

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:53.150
So with this, you get the clock table.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.670
Okay. Now go into the items part.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.810
You will see two Python blocks,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.500
which is what the next instruction says.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.526
Go into the python block 

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:06.180
and do Control-c c (C-c c).

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.860
Go to the control python source block,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.413
second one, and do Ctrl-c c... 

00:07:12.413 --> 00:07:14.490
Ctrl-c Ctrl-c (C-c C-c) rather.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.028
and then finally come back 

00:07:16.028 --> 00:07:18.765
to Raise Invoice and do dispatcher 

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:21.270
which is exported into PDF.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.718
Okay, let's do that. 

00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:27.853
First one is... I just run this code, 

00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:30.950
and it generated this table for me.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.160
Okay. So it has all the details.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.253
Now we go in 

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:39.560
the second source code block,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.700
and does all this...

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.530
And it has generated this stuff.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.335
Plus, you should note that for beancount, 

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:50.795
it has also generated the block for that.

00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:51.775
It's all in the code. 

00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:53.820
You can customize it if you're on Ledger.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.782
You can customize it 

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:55.390
to the way you want, 

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.978
any accounts that you want to change. 

00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:58.870
It's all customizable. 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.710
Here, even the currency symbols

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.840
can be changed from INR and Rupees

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.681
to whatever currency you have

00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:07.190
can be changed accordingly.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.304
I have org-babel-tangle-append code 

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.650
that I will share in the...

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.872
I've borrowed it 

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:14.889
from somebody on the Internet,

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.440
so I'll share that as well 

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.650
in my GitHub repo.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.830
Lastly, I just want to share that

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.730
you can fill your GST website

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.988
with these info, 

00:08:24.988 --> 00:08:26.171
so you can... You can even put in 

00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:27.590
as many entries as you want 

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.370
in your yasnippet.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.560
Customize it the way you want.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.590
I also added a month later 

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.820
due date reminder,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.239
saying if the invoice is paid or not.

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:37.209
Okay.

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:42.051
So, a few tips to end this demo. 

00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:44.990
You can customize currency symbol 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.860
and currency words

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.540
according to your own currency.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.269
I use the European/Indian date format

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:54.980
which is %d-%m-%Y. You can also...

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.816
The language is Indian English, 

00:08:56.816 --> 00:08:57.998
so it will change according--

00:08:57.998 --> 00:08:59.860
the numerals change according to the

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.180
Indian format. Numbering format

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.959
for invoice number is today's date

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.620
followed by client name.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.959
That's my default.

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.120
You can customize that as well.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.574
Let's try and export this 

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.325
to the subtree. Ctrl-s. 

00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:20.579
So that's step number seven.

00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:22.029
And there it is,

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.339
the tax invoice 

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.870
for Dr. Wile E. Coyote,

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.810
and with a lovely signature as well.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.990
[Interviewer:] Well, that's great!

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.309
If I were to try this out, what do I do?

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:36.779
Go to github.com, into my repository.

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:38.915
I'll leave my GitHub URL. 

00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:42.790
You can download it, use it,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.848
and let me know 

00:09:43.848 --> 00:09:46.829
how it pans out for you.

00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:47.632
[Interviewer:] I have spent

00:09:47.632 --> 00:09:49.018
so much time on this.

00:09:49.018 --> 00:09:50.060
May I invoice you?

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.060
[Scoffs]

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.060
